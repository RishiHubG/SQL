Assessment (& Domain) Questions:
1. is one json related to a single assessment?
2. will an assessment have a key as well?
3. will the properties be identified by name (the uniqueness)? (only insert/delete for properties)
thus a property can be added/modified/deleted and identified using name?
4. How to recognize if an assessment has properties or not? So any node with name not "Label" is a property?
5. will all the 4 tables have versionNum and all history tables verionNum and currentIdentifier?
6. RegisterPropertyXerf_Data_history: this will also have only column additions(same as base table)?
